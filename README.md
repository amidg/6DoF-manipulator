# 6DoF-manipulator
My school project from 2020 that analyzes and animates 6DoF robotic manipulator for the automated electrical panel wiring
I usually post only the best school project I had in the past because there is no reason to publish everything. Everyone has pretty much same school projects accross North America.

**What does it do?**
This project utilizes concepts of forward and inverse kinematics as well as Jacobians to calculate and animate operation of the 6 DoF robotic manipualtor. .mat files are derived from SolidWorks CAD model. 

**What is the output?**
1. Torques and Forces accross all robotic joints
2. .gif animation of manipulator operation
